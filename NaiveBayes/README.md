# Naive Bayes Classifier
This is an implementation of a __Naive Bayes Classifier__ used to classify data over the [Congressional Voting Records Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records).

It uses Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities and logarithms for calculating them. Ten-fold cross-validation is used for evaluating the model.
