# K-Means clustering


This is an implementation of __K-Means clustering algorithm__ used to cluster a set of random points. It also visualizes the points, cetroids and clusters.

There are 3 cli args:
- *dataset* - used to specify which dataset to use the "normal" or "unbalance" one;
- *k* - the number of clusters;
- *i* - the number of iterations;

Example usage:
`python main.py -dataset normal -k 5 -i 2`
